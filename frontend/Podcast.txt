Podcast-- Freakonomics - "The Stupidest Thing You Can Do With Your Money"
Cole's takeaways
- Generally, managed funds do not out perform the market.
- There's a misconception that as a person, you're "above average" and that even
though beating the market is hard, you can do it.
- Even if the fund manager/advisor doesn't actually help market performance,
they are able to act as a sort of guide amidst the market to their clients,
thereby offering them a form of emotional support.
- Index funds are actually a fairly new thing and haven't been around for that
long relative to how long finance has existed for.
- An ETF is not an index! It's a collection of different securities. Some are
managed, like mutual funds, and some parts of it are passively invested. ETFs
are generally less expensive.

According to a lot of people, it's stupid to get a mutual fund. I'm still on the
fence about them, even after hearing that podcast. However, the data show that
mutual funds really don't out perform the market most of the time. I'd guess
that the ones that do are just lucky. It's important to have a financial advisor
though, since they can tell you the terms of the market and perhaps lead you to
make more informed and beneficial choices.
